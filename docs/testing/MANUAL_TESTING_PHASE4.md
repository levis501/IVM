## Prerequisites

Before running these tests, ensure:

1. Docker is running and the database is up:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Database is migrated and seeded:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

3. Dev server is running:
   ```bash
   /home/levis/Development/IVM/scripts/kill3000_and_start_dev.sh
   ```

4. Bootstrap user exists: `indianvillagemanor+bootstrap@gmail.com` (dbadmin + verifier roles)

5. Some audit log history exists (perform a few actions like login, register a test user, etc.)

---

## M13: Comprehensive Audit Logging

### Setup
Log in as the bootstrap user (dbadmin) via magic link at http://localhost:3000/auth/login.

---

### Test 1: Audit Log Viewer

1. Navigate to **Admin Console** > **Audit Logs** (`/admin/console/audit-logs`).
2. Verify the page loads with a table of audit log entries.
3. Verify each entry shows: timestamp, action, actor, entity type, success/failure.
4. Click on an entry row to expand — verify JSON details are shown.

**Expected**: Audit log viewer loads with entries and expandable details.

---

### Test 2: Search and Filter

1. On the Audit Logs page, type a search term (e.g., the bootstrap user's email) in the search box.
2. Verify filtered results appear.
3. Use the **Action** dropdown to filter by a specific action type (e.g., `LOGIN_ATTEMPT`).
4. Use the **Date From** / **Date To** fields to restrict by date range.
5. Verify pagination works (if enough entries exist).

**Expected**: Filters narrow down results correctly. Pagination works.

---

### Test 3: CSV Export

1. Apply a filter (e.g., by action type).
2. Click **Export CSV**.
3. Verify a CSV file downloads.
4. Open the CSV — verify it contains the filtered audit log entries with headers.

**Expected**: CSV file downloads with correct data.

---

### Test 4: Log Cleanup

1. Click **Cleanup Old Logs** button.
2. Confirm in the dialog.
3. Verify a success message shows the number of deleted entries (may be 0 if no old entries).

**Expected**: Cleanup runs without error. Message shows deletion count.

---

### Test 5: Bot Detection in Logs

1. From a terminal, make a request with a bot user-agent:
   ```bash
   curl -A "Googlebot/2.1" http://localhost:3000/
   ```
2. Check the audit log — bot page views should NOT appear (filtered out).
3. Make a normal browser request — verify it IS logged.

**Expected**: Bot traffic is silently filtered from anonymous page view logs.

---

### Test 6: Audit Logs Card on Admin Console

1. Navigate to `/admin/console`.
2. Verify the **Audit Logs** card appears in the Console Sections grid.
3. Click it — verify it navigates to the audit log viewer.

---

## M14: SSO Authentication

### Test 7: SSO Buttons (Without Credentials)

1. Ensure `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID` are NOT set in `.env`.

**Expected**: Login page shows only email/magic link when SSO is not configured.

---

### Test 8: SSO Buttons (With Credentials)

1. Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env` (can be dummy values for UI testing).
2. Restart the dev server.
3. Navigate to `/auth/login`.
4. Verify a **"Continue with Google"** button appears above the magic link form.
5. Verify the "or continue with email" divider is shown between SSO buttons and the email form.

**Expected**: SSO button appears when credentials are configured. Divider separates SSO from email.

---

### Test 9: Provider Info API

1. Call the providers API:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/providers-info
   ```
2. Verify the response lists configured providers (or empty array if none configured).

**Expected**: JSON response with providers list.

---

### Test 10: SSO Error for Unregistered User

1. Navigate to `/auth/error?error=SSONotRegistered`.

   ```bash
   ls -la docker-entrypoint.sh
   ```

**Expected**: Production Docker configuration is complete.

---

### Test 14: Nginx Configuration

1. Verify `nginx/default.conf` exists.

   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/auth/login
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health
