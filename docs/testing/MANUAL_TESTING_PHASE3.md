# Phase 3 Manual Testing Guide

This guide covers manual testing procedures for all Phase 3 milestones:
- **M09**: Committee System
- **M10**: Document Publishing System
- **M11**: Event Calendar System
- **M12**: Admin Console

## Prerequisites

Before running these tests, ensure:

1. Docker is running and the database is up:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Database is migrated and seeded:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

3. Dev server is running:
   ```bash
   /home/levis/Development/IVM/scripts/kill3000_and_start_dev.sh
   ```

4. Bootstrap user exists: `indianvillagemanor+bootstrap@gmail.com` (dbadmin role)

5. For document tests, the `/data/documents` directory will be auto-created - no manual setup needed.

## Cross-Feature Integration Tests

### Integration Test 1: Full Committee + Document Workflow

1. Create committee "Finance" as dbadmin.
2. Add a user with publisher role as a member.

4. Publish the document.
5. Verify it appears in Finance committee detail page.
6. Verify Finance appears in the navigation menu for the publisher.
7. Log in as a different verified user with no special roles.
8. Finance should NOT appear in their navigation (no published docs... wait, it now has one).
9. Actually: Finance SHOULD appear for all verified users since it has a published document.
10. Verify the verified user can see and download the document.

**Expected**: Committees with published documents are visible to all verified users.

---

### Integration Test 2: Admin Console → Calendar → Events

1. As dbadmin, use Admin Console to assign calendar role to a test user.
2. Log in as that test user.
3. Verify Calendar link appears in menu.
4. Create a new event.
5. Log out — verify event is visible publicly if it's current/future month.

**Expected**: Role assignment immediately grants access to event management.

---

### Integration Test 3: Publisher Access Control

1. Create user Alice. Assign publisher role. Add to Board committee.
2. Create user Bob. Assign publisher role. Do NOT add to any committee.
3. Log in as Alice → `/committees/<board-id>/documents` → access granted ✅
4. Log in as Bob → `/committees/<board-id>/documents` → access denied ✅
5. As dbadmin, add Bob to Board.
6. Log in as Bob → `/committees/<board-id>/documents` → access granted ✅

**Expected**: Publisher role + committee membership both required for document management.

---

## Known Limitations and Notes

- **Document storage**: The `/data/documents` directory is created automatically on first upload. In development, this defaults to the local filesystem. In production, this should be a mounted Docker volume.
- **File size limits**: The 25 MB limit is enforced server-side and read from `SystemConfig.max_upload_size_mb`. Very large files may timeout before the size check fires in some browsers.
- **Email sending**: Email notifications (approval, denial, verifier notifications) require a working SMTP configuration in `.env`. In development without SMTP configured, the notification will fail silently (auth/verification actions still succeed).
- **Audit logs**: Visible in Prisma Studio (`npx prisma studio`) under the AuditLog table. A browser UI for audit logs is planned for M13.
- **Past event boundary**: "Past" means before the start of the current calendar month (not just "yesterday").
- **Committee deletion**: Committees with any documents (published, archived, or deleted) cannot be deleted. Documents must be permanently deleted from trash and others removed first.
