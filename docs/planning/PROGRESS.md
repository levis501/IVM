## Phase 2: User Management (M5-M8.5)

### M05: User Registration Flow
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2026-02-17
**Completed**: 2026-02-17

**Goal**: New users can register with required information and receive confirmation of pending verification status.

**Key Deliverables**:
- [x] Registration form with validation (firstName, lastName, email, phone, unit, resident/owner checkboxes)
- [x] Zod schema for registration data validation
- [x] Required fields validation enforced
- [x] Unit number validation (alphanumeric, max 6 characters)

- [x] Duplicate email detection
- [x] Register link added to site menu for unauthenticated users
- [x] Register link added to login page

**New Files Created**:
- `lib/validation.ts` - Zod validation schema for registration
- `app/register/page.tsx` - Registration form
- `app/register/confirmation/page.tsx` - Registration confirmation page
- `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Registration API endpoint

**Files Modified**:
- `components/site_menu.tsx` - Added Register link for unauthenticated users
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Added "Create an account" link

**Technical Notes**:
- Uses role-based system (resident/owner roles) instead of boolean fields (isResident/isOwner)
- Unit numbers are normalized to uppercase during registration
- Roles are assigned via many-to-many relationship with Role table
- Zod safeParse used for validation with detailed error messages
- All validation errors properly displayed to users

**Manual Test Results**:
- ✅ Registration form accessible at /register
- ✅ All required fields validated (firstName, lastName, email, phone, unit)
- ✅ At least one of resident/owner checkbox required
- ✅ Unit number validation works (alphanumeric, max 6 chars)
- ✅ Duplicate email detection works
- ✅ Users created with pending verification status
- ✅ Roles (resident, owner, or both) properly assigned
- ✅ Confirmation page displays appropriate message
- ✅ Pending users cannot log in (enforced by M03)

**Issues Resolved**:
- Fixed Zod validation error handling by using safeParse instead of parse
- Corrected Zod error property (issues instead of errors)
- Added zod package to dependencies

**Details**: See [M05-user-registration.md](./M05-user-registration.md)

---

### M06: Verifier Notification System
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2026-02-17
**Completed**: 2026-02-17
**Key Deliverables**:
- [x] `lib/notifications.ts` with `sendVerifierNotification` function
- [x] Email notification to all verified users with verifier role on new registration
- [x] Email uses `verifier-notification` template from EmailTemplate table
- [x] Notification includes: firstName, lastName, email, phone, unit, resident/owner status, verification link
- [x] Verification link points to `/admin/verify` (to be implemented in M07)
- [x] Failed email notification sent to all dbadmin users
- [x] All notification actions logged to AuditLog
- [x] Notification is non-blocking (registration succeeds even if email fails)

**New Files Created**:
- `lib/notifications.ts` - `sendVerifierNotification` and `notifyDbAdminOfEmailFailure` functions

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Added `sendVerifierNotification` call after user creation; fixed pre-existing missing `success` field in `logAuditEvent` call

**Technical Notes**:
- Notification is fire-and-forget (non-blocking) so registration API response is not delayed by email sending
- Only `verified` users with `verifier` role receive notifications (not pending/denied verifiers)
- isResident/isOwner status derived from user's roles array (matches role-based schema)
- dbadmin fallback alert uses inline email body (no template required for this edge case)

**Issues Resolved**:
- Pre-existing TypeScript error in `register/route.ts`: `logAuditEvent` call was missing required `success: boolean` field (fixed as part of this milestone)

---

### M07: Verifier Approval/Denial Flow
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2026-02-17

- [x] Approved users assigned "user" role automatically
- [x] Audit log entries for both approve and deny actions
- [x] Non-verifiers blocked from API and dashboard (401/403)
- [x] "Verify Users" menu item shown only to verifier role users

**New Files Created**:
- `app/admin/verify/page.tsx` - Verifier dashboard with pending user cards, comment fields, approve/deny buttons
- `app/api/admin/verify/route.ts` - GET (list pending users) and POST (approve/deny) API endpoint

**Files Modified**:
- `components/site_menu.tsx` - Added "Verify Users" link for verifier role users

**Technical Notes**:
- Dashboard uses inline styles consistent with project patterns
- User cards display name, email, phone, unit, resident/owner badges, and registration date
- Comment field is optional but recommended for verification decisions
- Already-verified/denied users cannot be re-processed (400 error)
- Email sending is non-blocking; verification succeeds even if email fails

---

### M08: Verified User Access
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2026-02-17
**Completed**: 2026-02-17

**Goal**: Verified users can access protected areas of the site.

- [x] User dashboard page showing account status, roles, and navigation cards
- [x] Pending users see warning about limited access on dashboard
- [x] Pending/denied users blocked at login (M03, unchanged)
- [x] Dashboard, Events, and My Profile links added to site menu for authenticated users

**New Files Created**:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - User dashboard with status card and navigation
- `app/events/page.tsx` - Events listing with past event filtering
- `app/api/events/route.ts` - Events API with verification-aware filtering

**Files Modified**:
- `middleware.ts` - Updated with JWT-based auth checks for protected routes
- `components/site_menu.tsx` - Added Dashboard, Events, and My Profile links

**Technical Notes**:
- Middleware uses `next-auth/jwt` `getToken()` for Edge Runtime compatibility
- Past event boundary: events before start of current calendar month require verified login
- No separate middleware for verifier routes; role check is in the API/page component level
- Events page is accessible to all but content is filtered by verification status

---

### M08.5: User Profile Management
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2026-02-17
**Completed**: 2026-02-17

**Goal**: Verified users can update their profile information with re-verification flow.

**Key Deliverables**:
- [x] Profile page showing all user details (firstName, lastName, email, phone, unitNumber, resident/owner)
- [x] Profile edit form with inline editing toggle
- [x] Validation on profile update (required fields, max lengths, at least one role)
- [x] Re-verification flow: changes to firstName, lastName, phone, unitNumber, or resident/owner revert status to "pending"
- [x] Confirmation dialog before saving changes that trigger re-verification
- [x] Cancel option to discard changes and maintain verified status
- [x] Profile-update-reverify email sent to user when re-verification triggered
- [x] Verifier notification sent when profile update requires re-verification
- [x] Audit log for profile updates (records changes and whether re-verification triggered)

- [x] Account status badge displayed on profile page

**New Files Created**:
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Profile view/edit page with re-verification confirmation dialog
- `app/api/profile/route.ts` - GET (fetch profile) and PUT (update profile) API endpoint

**Technical Notes**:
- Email change is intentionally disabled per admin-only policy; email field shown as read-only with explanatory note
- The M08.5 milestone doc mentions email confirmation flow, but since email is tied to authentication (magic link), changing it would be complex and disruptive - deferred to a future milestone or admin operation
- Role changes (resident/owner) also trigger re-verification since they affect community membership
- Profile link was already added to site menu in M08

- CSV export limited to 10,000 entries per export

---

### M14: SSO Authentication
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2026-02-17
**Completed**: 2026-02-17

- `next.config.ts` - Added output: "standalone"

**Technical Notes**:
- Development docker-compose.yml unchanged for local dev
- App runs as non-root user (nextjs:nodejs, UID 1001)
- Nginx handles client_max_body_size 50M for uploads

### M16: Backup and Recovery
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2026-02-17
**Completed**: 2026-02-17

**Key Deliverables**:
- [x] Backup script (scripts/backup/backup.sh) for database, documents, and logs
- [x] Restore script (scripts/backup/restore.sh) with interactive confirmation
- [x] Optional AES-256-CBC encryption via BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY
- [x] Configurable backup retention with automatic cleanup (default 30 days)
- [x] Crontab example for scheduled daily backups at 2:00 AM
- [x] DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md already comprehensive (created earlier)
- [x] PostgreSQL custom-format dump for efficient restore
- [x] Combined archive creation (database + documents + logs)

**New Files Created**:
- `scripts/backup/backup.sh` - Full backup script with encryption
- `scripts/backup/restore.sh` - Interactive restore script with decryption
- `scripts/backup/crontab.example` - Cron schedule for automated backups

**Technical Notes**:
- Backup format: tar.gz (or tar.gz.enc when encrypted)
- Database: pg_dump custom format (--format=custom) for selective restore
- Documents and logs compressed separately before combining
- Restore script prompts before overwriting database
- Old backups older than retention period auto-deleted
- DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md already covers migration rollback testing

### M17: Security Hardening
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2026-02-17
**Completed**: 2026-02-17

**Key Deliverables**:
- [x] Security headers in middleware: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security
- [x] Security headers applied to ALL responses (matcher broadened to catch all non-static routes)
- [x] Input sanitization library (lib/sanitize.ts): HTML escaping, string sanitization, filename sanitization, email sanitization
- [x] SQL injection pattern detection (defense-in-depth logging, Prisma already prevents injection)
- [x] File upload security already implemented in M10 (MIME type + extension + size validation, path traversal protection)
- [x] Rate limiting already implemented in M03 (login attempts, magic link requests)
- [x] CSRF protection via NextAuth (JWT strategy with HTTP-only cookies)
- [x] XSS prevention via React (auto-escaping) + CSP header + sanitize utility
- [x] SQL injection prevention via Prisma parameterized queries
- [x] Secure session configuration via JWT HTTP-only cookies (M03)
- [x] Dependency vulnerability scan: 9 moderate issues in eslint dev dependencies (no production vulnerabilities)

**New Files Created**:
- `lib/sanitize.ts` - Input sanitization utilities (escapeHtml, sanitizeString, sanitizeFilename, sanitizeEmail, hasSqlInjectionPatterns)

**Files Modified**:
- `middleware.ts` - Added security headers to all responses, broadened matcher to cover all routes

**Technical Notes**:
- CSP allows 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' for Next.js SSR compatibility
- Nginx also adds security headers (nginx/default.conf) for defense-in-depth
- npm audit shows 9 moderate vulnerabilities in eslint dev dependencies only; no production vulnerabilities
- Prisma handles SQL injection prevention at the ORM level; sanitize.ts provides defense-in-depth detection

### M18: Testing Infrastructure and Coverage
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2026-02-17
**Completed**: 2026-02-17

**Key Deliverables**:
- [x] Jest configuration for unit/integration tests (ts-jest preset, @/ path mapping)
- [x] Playwright configuration for E2E tests (Chromium, 30s timeout, html+list reporters)
- [x] Unit tests for utility libraries: sanitize.ts (14 tests), audit.ts (10 tests), validation.ts (11 tests + various phone formats)
- [x] E2E test suite: public page loading, security headers verification, protected route redirects
- [x] Test coverage reporting with Istanbul (60% threshold for global coverage)
- [x] npm test scripts: test, test:watch, test:coverage, test:e2e, test:e2e:ui, test:all, typecheck
- [x] All 46 unit tests passing
- [x] TypeScript type-checking clean (npx tsc --noEmit)
- [x] Fixed hasSqlInjectionPatterns regex to avoid false positives on natural language text

**New Files Created**:
- `jest.config.ts` - Jest configuration with ts-jest, path mapping, coverage thresholds
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright config (Chromium, single worker, retry once)
- `__tests__/lib/sanitize.test.ts` - Unit tests for escapeHtml, sanitizeString, sanitizeFilename, sanitizeEmail, hasSqlInjectionPatterns
- `__tests__/lib/audit.test.ts` - Unit tests for isBot (bot detection) and formatActor (actor display formatting)
- `__tests__/lib/validation.test.ts` - Unit tests for registrationSchema Zod validation
- `e2e/basic.spec.ts` - E2E tests for public pages, security headers, and auth redirects

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json` - Added test scripts and dev dependencies (jest, ts-jest, @types/jest, playwright, @playwright/test)
- `lib/sanitize.ts` - Fixed hasSqlInjectionPatterns regex patterns (SELECT * FROM, column lists, UNION SELECT, INSERT INTO instead of overly broad keyword matching)

**Technical Notes**:
- Jest uses --forceExit flag due to setInterval in audit.ts rate limiting (non-blocking)
- E2E tests require a running dev server (localhost:3000) to execute
- Coverage thresholds set at 60% globally (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- hasSqlInjectionPatterns refactored to detect specific SQL patterns (SELECT * FROM, SELECT col,, UNION SELECT, DROP TABLE, INSERT INTO, OR 1=1) without false positives on natural English text like "please select the document from the list"
