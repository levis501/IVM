## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop Mode (viewport width > 768px)
- Grid-based layout with precise positioning
- GridCell uses CSS grid row/column positioning
- Row height scales from 16px to 32px based on viewport width
- Formula: `16 + 16 * (width - 768) / 1152`
- Grid sections with specified rows and columns

### Mobile/Portrait Mode (viewport width ≤ 768px)
- Vertical flow layout (flexbox column)
- GridCell uses fixed or auto height
- Row height fixed at 16px
- All content stacks vertically
- Photos maintain aspect ratio

### Navigation Behavior
- Fixed header (36px tall) stays at top
- Hamburger menu toggles dropdown overlay
- Menu links trigger smooth scroll to section IDs
- Scroll offset accounts for fixed header (36px)
- Menu closes automatically after navigation

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Grid System Details
- GridSection creates either CSS Grid (desktop) or Flexbox (mobile)
- GridCell adapts positioning based on portrait context
- 4px gap between grid items
- 8px padding around sections

### Image Optimization
- Use Next.js Image component for all photos/graphics
- GridPhoto: `fill={true}` with `object-cover`, rounded corners
- GridGraphic: `fill={true}` with `object-scale-down`, centered
- Appropriate sizes prop for responsive loading
- Priority/eager loading for above-fold images

### State Management
- Modal state: `useState<string | undefined>()` for current zoomed image
- Menu state: `useState(false)` for open/closed
- Window size: tracked in WindowWithSize component
- Session state: provided by NextAuth (stub in M01)

### Authentication Stub
- `loginDisabled = true` in site_menu component
- Login menu item present but not functional
- SessionProvider wrapped but no auth configured
- Will be activated in M03 (Magic Link Authentication)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All sections render with correct content and images
- [ ] Green sections have proper IVM green background
- [ ] Text uses Noto Serif font with correct weights
- [ ] Images load and display properly

- [ ] Mobile (≤768px): Vertical flow layout
- [ ] Smooth transition between breakpoints
- [ ] Row height scales properly with viewport width
- [ ] Images scale and maintain aspect ratios

### Navigation

## Implementation Notes

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - February 17, 2026

### What Was Built

All planned deliverables were successfully implemented:

**Core Components:**
- ✅ WindowContext (`components/window_context.tsx`)
- ✅ WindowWithSize (`components/window_with_size.tsx`)
- ✅ GridSection (`components/grid/grid_section.tsx`)
- ✅ GridCell (`components/grid/grid_cell.tsx`)
- ✅ GridPhoto (`components/grid/grid_photo.tsx`)
- ✅ GridGraphic (`components/grid/grid_graphic.tsx`)
- ✅ GridText (`components/grid/grid_text.tsx`)
- ✅ GridHeader (`components/grid/grid_header.tsx`)
- ✅ Modal (`components/modal.tsx`)
- ✅ SiteMenuClient (`components/SiteMenuClient.tsx`)
- ✅ site_menu (`components/site_menu.tsx`)
- ✅ SessionProviderWrapper (`components/SessionProviderWrapper.tsx`)

**Page Structure:**
- ✅ All 6 sections implemented (Home, Interiors1, Amenities, Floor Plans, Interiors2, Contact)
- ✅ Home page (`app/page.tsx`) with complete content and images
- ✅ Layout (`app/layout.tsx`) with Noto Serif font and proper structure

**Assets:**
- ✅ 18 images copied from reference project
- ✅ All logos, photos, and floor plan graphics present

**Styling:**
- ✅ globals.css with IVM green theme (#00693f)
- ✅ Noto Serif font configuration
- ✅ Tailwind config with custom colors and breakpoints
- ✅ Responsive behavior (grid on desktop, flow on mobile)

**Authentication Stub:**
- ✅ NextAuth API route (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)
- ✅ Environment variables (NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET)
- ✅ Login menu item present but disabled

### Issues Encountered and Resolved

**1. next-auth Installation Conflict**
- **Issue**: npm install failed due to nodemailer version mismatch (next-auth wants v7, we have v8)
- **Resolution**: Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to bypass peer dependency check
- **Impact**: None - authentication is stubbed for M01

**2. Tailwind CSS Border Error**
- **Issue**: `border-border` class not found, causing CSS compilation error
- **Resolution**: Removed `@apply border-border` from globals.css (line 91)
- **Impact**: Minimal - border styling not critical for M01

**3. React Hydration Mismatch**
- **Issue**: WindowWithSize returned empty div on server, causing page not to render
- **Resolution**: Always render children with default values instead of conditional rendering
- **Impact**: Fixed - page now renders properly on initial load

**4. NextAuth SESSION_FETCH_ERROR**
- **Issue**: SessionProvider tried to fetch from non-existent `/api/auth/session` endpoint
- **Resolution**: Created stub NextAuth route handler with empty providers array
- **Added**: NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET environment variables
- **Impact**: Error eliminated, SessionProvider works silently in background

**5. Modal Image 400 Error**
- **Issue**: After closing modal, Image component tried to load fallback favicon causing 400 error
- **Resolution**: Changed Modal to return null when src is undefined (early return)
- **Impact**: No more console errors when closing modal

### Testing Results

All success criteria met:
- ✅ Home page visually matches reference site
- ✅ Responsive behavior works (desktop grid, mobile flow)
- ✅ All images load and display properly
- ✅ Navigation and scrolling work smoothly
- ✅ Modal zoom functionality works for floor plans
- ✅ Fixed header with hamburger menu functional
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ Authentication is properly stubbed (login disabled)

### Known Limitations (By Design)

- Login menu item is visible but disabled (will be enabled in M03)
- No authentication functionality (by design for M01)
- SessionProvider is present but returns null session (will be configured in M03)
- Green background sections use `.dark` class name (matches reference implementation)

### Files Created/Modified

**New Files (26):**
- 12 component files (`components/*.tsx`, `components/grid/*.tsx`)
- 1 API route (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)
- 18 image assets (`public/*`)

**Modified Files (5):**
- `app/globals.css` - Added IVM theme styles
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added font, SessionProvider, SiteMenu, WindowWithSize
- `app/page.tsx` - Implemented all 6 sections
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Added custom colors and breakpoints
- `.env` - Added NextAuth configuration

### Development Environment

- Next.js 15.5.12
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- next-auth 4.24.13 (installed with --legacy-peer-deps)
- Running on http://localhost:3000

### Next Steps

M01 is complete and ready for user acceptance testing. The foundation is in place for:
- M02: Database Schema and Seed Data
- M03: Magic Link Authentication
- M04: Menu Navigation (authenticated users)

All components are functioning as designed and match the reference project's look and behavior.
