# Testing Strategy Summary

## Manual Testing Checklist
Each milestone includes specific manual test steps. For acceptance testing:
1. Start with anonymous user experience (M1)
2. Verify bootstrap user login (M2-4)
3. Complete full verifier flow (M5-8)
4. Test user profile management (M8.5)
5. Test all role-specific features (M9-12)
6. Verify comprehensive audit logging (M13)
7. Verify security features (M17)
8. Perform backup/recovery test (M16)
9. Verify monitoring and alerting (M20)

## Automated Testing Approach
- Unit tests: Run on every commit
- Integration tests: Run on every commit
- **E2E tests: Written alongside features in M3-M13, run before deployment**
- CI pipeline: Lint → TypeCheck → Unit Tests → Integration Tests → Build → E2E Tests
- Coverage requirements: >80% for critical paths
