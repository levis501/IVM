**Goal**: Complete documentation for developers and operators.

**Features**:
- README.md with:
  - Project overview
  - Setup instructions
  - Environment variables
  - Development workflow
- **DATABASE.md** (already created):
  - Complete schema documentation
  - Relationships and constraints
  - Indexes and performance notes
  - Security considerations
- **DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md** (already created):
  - Migration deployment strategy
  - Rollback procedures
  - Testing requirements
  - Production deployment checklist
- DEPLOYMENT.md with:
  - Deployment steps

  - Docker commands
  - Troubleshooting
- OPERATIONS.md with:
  - Backup and recovery procedures
  - Monitoring recommendations
  - Log locations (/data/logs, /data/documents)
  - Common administrative tasks
  - Responding to alerts

- Code comments for complex logic

**Manual Tests**:
1. Follow README setup instructions on fresh machine - verify works
2. Follow DATABASE.md to understand schema - verify accuracy
3. Follow DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md to deploy a test migration - verify process works
4. Follow DEPLOYMENT.md to deploy to staging environment - verify successful deployment
5. Use OPERATIONS.md to perform common tasks (backup, restore, view logs)
6. Verify all environment variables are documented
7. Review API documentation for completeness
8. Test all documented procedures

**Automated Tests**:
- Documentation link checker (verify no broken links)
- Code examples in docs are valid (can be executed)
- Environment variable documentation matches code (script to verify)
- Shell commands in documentation are syntactically valid
